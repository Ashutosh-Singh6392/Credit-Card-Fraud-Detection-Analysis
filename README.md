# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection-Analysis
From intricately handling data preprocessing to effectively addressing class imbalance and implementing advanced classification techniques, this effort represents a comprehensive approach to combating fraud.

1. Establishing Strong Defenses: Developed a machine learning model for detecting Credit Card Fraud.

2. Handled data preprocessing, ensured data normalization, and managed class distribution.

3.Trained a classifier, such as logistic regression or random forests, to identify fraudulent activity.

4. Assessed model performance through precision, recall, and F1-score evaluation for robust analysis.

5. Explored techniques like oversampling and undersampling to improve results. Let's witness how various strategies form a robust defense against financial threats.
